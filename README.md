# YouTube Transcript Downloader
`youtube-transcript` is a tool designed to help you download subtitles from YouTube videos, in any available language.
The live version is available [here](https://tomproberts.github.io/youtube-transcript).

## Caveats
`youtube-transcript` cannot be used to download auto-generated captions from a YouTube video, but can be used to download
any captions that would be available when watching the video on YouTube itself.

## Run Locally
### Install packages
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

npm run serve
```
